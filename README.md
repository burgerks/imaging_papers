scripts for published NIBL papers
Of note, some of these methods may be considered outdated and should be used with caution and should be considered a repository for published material for replication purposes etc... If you seek to perform analyses and are looking for scripts, we recommend looking at fMRIPREP located here: https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep
